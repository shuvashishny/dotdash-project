// depending on the IDE/environment you use, your project files can reside here.

I used Java with Selenium to write the tests and used page object model.
Project I created is Java Maven project, so I followed the Maven structure
I am copying the src folder so total structure will be there


Api tests are here test -> java -> apitest package
Selenium tests are here test -> java -> pages
